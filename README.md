# [Interfacing MPU6050 With Arduino]
<br>
<br>
The MPU6050 is a very popular accelerometer gyroscope chip. MPU6050 has six axes sense with a 16-bit measurement resolution. This high accuracy in sense and the cheap cost makes it very popular among the DIY community. Even many commercial products come equipped with the MPU6050. The combination of gyroscope and accelerometers is commonly referred to as an Inertial Measurement Unit or IMU.
IMU sensors are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phones, tablets, satellites, spacecraft, drones, UAVs, robotics and many more. They are used for motion tracking, orientation and position detection, flight control etc.
